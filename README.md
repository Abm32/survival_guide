### Project Description
An absurdly essential guide for surviving not just a zombie apocalypse but any random scenario we might imagine‚Äîlike an alien invasion or an outbreak of sentient toasters!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
What if, one day, we are faced with the imminent threat of an alien invasion or a zombie apocalypse, and no one knows where to find the nearest canned beans or how to create a forcefield out of household items?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
In the far future, and in the nearby future and in the present when an apocalypse occurs our opensource guide acts as a escape route for them to refer. More people are welcome to contribute to this futuristic project.üòùüòù
